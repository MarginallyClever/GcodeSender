#GcodeSender

This program will feed instructions to an serial device one line at a time.
It waits for the ">" character between each send.

## I just want to run it!

./java/GcodeSender.jar is compiled and should run.

On most systems you can double click it to start.

On some you may need to do something like

    java -classpath RXTXcomm.jar -Djava.library.path=[path to RXTXcomm.jar] -jar DrawbotGUI.jar
